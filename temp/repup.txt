<Chris_Gammell>        @rabid_inventor oh yeah, getting outside an ecosystem
                       puts all knowledge right back into the blender.
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor we've a big space :)
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor that would be amazing :)
<tech_fruits>          @rabid_inventor Nice one, wish I could go as well.
                       Can't wait to see your pics!
<guru>                 @rabid_inventor @tezib @rutlandarms @ianibbo shall I
                       cry you a river with the world's smallest violin? :)
<_Jo_Mo>               @rabid_inventor if you are up at 06:00 tomorrow there's
                       good view of the #ISS passing over your place too
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor I'm hoping everyone will bring a few
                       spare bits for others to use or share (CPC will also be
                       selling some bits)
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor thats what I'm hoping people do but we
                       have backups just incase :)
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor but we have no idea what the endpoint
                       is going to be, we've been unable to test it so far..
                       and if its a 2mb pipe.. :(
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor because of the new venue, we are
                       telling people not to expect connectivity, we are
                       bringing gear for wifi and ethernet
<guru>                 @rabid_inventor @pimoroni Cool. Not sure what the plan
                       is yet. Staying awake for 24hrs seems unlikely with
                       Pibow/Picade commitments :/
<yorkhannah>           @Thehodge @gistwire won't be seeing me I'm afraid but
                       we've put word out about it. @rabid_inventor and @guru
                       / @pimoroni were planning to go
<accessjames>          @rabid_inventor Guess that means that you're dumbstruck
                       by them? #zentweet
<dmcginnis>            @rabid_inventor Ha ha, I did think that was a rather
                       good word! Much better than overambitious... :)
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor no worries mate,we love shef and theres
                       a big geek scene there, hopefully able to convince
                       @Jagusti, @ianibbo to spread word
<Thehodge>             @rabid_inventor we can add more visitor ticekts easily
                       :)
<guru>                 @rabid_inventor we're going to see if we can bring a
                       team @pimoroni along ;)
<guru>                 @rabid_inventor know it well. Used to frequent when it
                       was the C&amp;C :) will arrange to drop by soon :)
